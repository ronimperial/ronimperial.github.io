    <h2>My Industrial Revolution Essay meets standards 2.2 and 2.9, because in my essay, I evaluated the contributions that Thomas Edison made during the Industrial Revolution. He has made numerous inventions in the past, although his version of the lightbulb was new, efficient, and affordable. Because of his invention, he was able to positively affect on our economic, social, and politic stand. With Thomas Edison's lightbulb quickly spreading throughout the entire nation, the number of lightbulbs sold was remarkable and able to positively affect the United States. Also, American Industrialists, such as Thomas Edison, were able to make business out of his invention. His lightbulb design spread to almost everyhome, and was a success. I constructed this product by utilizing 21st Century Skills including the use of technology to conduct research as well as the use of writing.</h2>

    <h2>This affected the 21st Century, because without this occurence it'd be hard to tell how far we'd be into technology to this day, and different business would be in different places. This is the same time coprorate capitalism began to rise. Without this occurence, we wouldn't be using as much lightbulbs and elevtricity as we currently do.</h2>

    <h2>The Cotton Gin Presentation Script that me and my team made meets standard 2.8, because it shows how the rise of corporations occured. We also spoke about this during our actual presentation. The Cotton Gin was not patented and so Eli Whitney was not able to make as much as he could have, but other corporations took this idea and used it to sell and make money. </h2>

    <h2>This is important to the 21st Century because without the Cotton Gin as well as other inventions, the rise of corporations would not have been as much or the same. The inventions and corporations from back then affected how we live today. Using The 21st Century Skills (conducting research with technology and applying writing skills) I was able to create this product and find the needed information. </h2>
