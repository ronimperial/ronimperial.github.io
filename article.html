    <h2>My Articles of Confederation Summaries, as well as my Articles of Confederation Booklet(with the help of my partner), both fit the standard of 1.7, because I evaluated the features of the U.S. Consitution within the texts. In both pieces of my work, I listed all of the Articles of Confederation, and included the checks and balances between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches as well as Article 5. I also included learning exercises and drawings to portray and remember all of the Articles of Confederation. Using 21st Century Skill #3(responding to hisorical text/literature) and 21st Century Skill #10 (utlizing techonological resources), I was able to create both of these products.  </h2>

    <h2>This is important to the 21st century because the Articles of Confederation and the unique features of the Constitution helped create and solidify the law as it is today. Without it, laws today would not be as solid and specific, leaving many loopholes or other complications within the U.S. government's law.</h2>

    <h2>The Articles of Confederation Debate Argument that I created assumes the standard 1.6, because I directly summarized and made arguements for or against the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. Using my use of technology and conduct research from a specific document as a 21st Century Skill, I was able to construct these arguments to prepare for a possible debate and possible counter arguments. It helped me understand the Constitution, as well as the Articles of Confederation better.</h2>
    <div class="text">

    <h2>This directly relates and is important to the 21st Century, because the laws made back then from the Constitution and Articles of Confederation made the laws today. We base all of our government laws off of the Constituion, which was based on the Articles of Confederation. Knowing why we keep or shouldn't keep the Constitution is important to know.</h2>
