    <h2> My populism questions sheet meets standard 2.10 as well as 2.11, because it determines the economic, social, and political causes and effects of the populist as well as progressive movements. It also utilized major social movements in the United States, because it tells the impact of the Populist movement on the economy and America itself. I used 20th Century Skills (using techonology for research and using writing skills) in order to make this product. </h2>
